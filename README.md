## Resume Tips
- Use a one-page PDF resume with clean formatting.
    - A one-page resume is often called a **resume**.
        - Most jobs only require a resume.
        - A detailed multi-page document is called a **CV**.
    - Avoid using formats like `.docx` that are not universally compatible. Use PDF.
        - Google Docs can be used to maintain the resume and downloaded as PDF.
    - Customize the resume for the specific company's needs.
        - For example, if you know React but the company uses Vue, emphasize that you're interested.
    - Ensure the resume is clear when printed in black and white or scanned.
        - Pay attention to colors, fonts, and sizes.
        - Use blue, underlined text for hyperlinks.
            - Underlining isn't necessary, and links can't be clicked on paper.
- Avoid providing personal information not related to your education, experience, or work.
    - Consider omitting a photo.
    - You don't need to state your gender.
    - Focus on your skills, projects, and work experience.
    - After gaining work experience, your education can be placed later in the resume.
    - Add hyperlinks where possible:
        - Previous companies
        - Graduated school
        - Projects you've worked on
- Include important contact information:
    - GitHub
    - Email
    - LinkedIn
    - Phone
- Showcase your work in previous projects:
    - Use numbers and specifics instead of vague descriptions.
    - Be prepared to explain every detail of the project at the top of your resume.
    - What exactly was your responsibility at work?
    - How did you tackle challenges?
    - What skills did you demonstrate?
- Prove your skills with actual projects.
    - Present what you’ve done using the technology.
    - Avoid stating “proficient,” “familiar,” or “70% skilled.”
        - Don’t exaggerate. If the interviewer asks detailed questions, be prepared.
    - You can summarize your skills at the beginning.

## 6. **Cloud Services and Serverless Architecture**
   - Advantages and limitations of serverless architectures (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)
   - Experience with common cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure)
   - Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation)

## 7. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Event sourcing principles
   - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
   - Ensuring consistency and reliability in event handling

## 8. **Advanced Database Operations**
   - Synchronization across multiple databases (e.g., replication, bidirectional sync)
   - OLAP vs OLTP
   - Backup and recovery strategies for large-scale databases
   - Time-series databases and their applications (e.g., InfluxDB)

These topics delve into more advanced backend development areas, especially around distributed systems, microservices, and performance optimization, which are often discussed in interviews for senior-level positions. Familiarity with these concepts will strengthen your backend interview preparation.
